## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Wiki](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/wiki).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

> Alternatively, you can join our [Discord](#community) and ask your question there.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [Wiki](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/wiki). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/labels/bug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback) if applicable
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Steps to reproduce the bug

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> For security related issues, please report a security vulnerability [here](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/security/advisories/new).

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Please select `Bug report` template and fill it out to the best of your abilities.
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once the issue is created:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needrepro`. Bugs with the `needrepro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needfix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Poke-guesser Bot, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/wiki) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider creating a fork.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/issues).

- Create a new issue and follow the provided `New Feature` template.
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Poke-guesser Bot users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Your First Code Contribution

Before creating your first contribution, please read and abide by our Code of Conduct to ensure this community remains welcoming and inclusive for all contributors.

- Check the open issues with the [enhancement label](https://github.com/GeorgeCiesinski/poke-guesser-bot/labels/enhancement) to see which features have been discussed.
- If you want to create an issue that hasn't been discussed yet, please [suggest](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion) the issue first to ensure it is a good fit for the project.
- Fork this project.
- Create a new branch for the issue. We recommend following [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) guidelines and naming your branch `feature/feature-name` or `hotfix/bug-name`.
- Create a test case for your feature if applicable. This will help to ensure future changes do not break this feature.
- If the issue is complete, create a pull request and one of our maintainers will go over the contribution before it is merged into the project.

### Improving The Documentation

Our goal is to keep the documentation as recent as possible, although we understand this can be a challenge. To help with this goal, please try to do the following when working on an issue:

- Ensure you have useful comments in your code to make future maintenance easier
- Update the README if one of the existing sections is changed as a result of your commit

In the event that your contribution is merged into the project, please update the wiki with any new commands or features, or other helpful information.

## Styleguides

At this time, we do not have a styleguide for this project as we did not have one picked when this project was started. This said, try to keep your code similar to existing code, especially if you are adding to an existing module. If in doubt, check out the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/) which has helpful styling recommendations.

### Commit Messages

Commit messages should be descriptive and include a summary of the change, as well as some bullet points for more specific details:

```
Added feature/new-feature
- Created new module abc
- Added function to xyz to validate user input
- Created a test case for new feature
```
