# Poké-guesser Bot

Poké-guesser Bot is a discord bot which selects random pokémon and asks the user to guess the pokémon name. The bot automatically tracks the score of participating users. It also recognizes a number of admin commands, and player commands such as catching pokémon, and displaying the leaderboard.

# Installation

# Technology

## Replit

We used the online IDE [Replit](https://replit.com/~) to create Poke-guesser Bot. The bot was intended to be ran straight from Replit so that it is hosted in the cloud.

## NodeJS

This project is written entirely using JavaScript in the [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment.

## discord.js

All interactions with discord were handled thanks to the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

## API

This bot would not be possible without [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). This API provided a list of all pokémon, including their variants, as well as sprites that were instrumental in building this Poke-guesser Bot.
