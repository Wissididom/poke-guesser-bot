# Installation

## Discord Bot Setup

In order to use Poke-guesser-bot, you need to setup a discord bot first using the Discord Developer Portal.

<!-- Keep ordered lists in html format -->
<ol>            
    <li>
        Login to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord Developer portal</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Follow <a href="https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot">these instructions</a> to setup the discord bot. Save the token from this step for later.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create the <a href="https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links">Bot Invite Link</a>, but select the below permissions before using the invite link:

    </li>
</ol>

## Create the .env and docker.env files

<ol>
     <li>
        Clone or download the repo.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a <code>.env</code> file if it doesn't exist. Copy the contents of <code>example.env</code> into the <code>.env</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the Discord Token to the <code>.env</code> file.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TOKEN:</strong> This is your discord token from previous steps.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the Database configuration to the <code>.env</code> file. There are two options: 
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you use a Database URL, add it to the <code>.env</code> file as below: 
                <br><code>DATABASE_URL: "postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname"</code> (your string)
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to pass the parameters separately to the Sequelize constructor, change the below fields in the .env file:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>POSTGRES_HOST:</strong> Connection string for Postgres server. Leave as <code>db</code> if using Docker.</li>
                    <li><strong>POSTGRES_USER & POSTGRES_PASSWORD:</strong> User/pass for postgres server. Doesn't need to be changed if using Docker.
                </ul>  
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy the contents of <code>.env</code> into <code>docker.env</code>
    </li>
</ol>

## Adding Slash Commands

The bot uses slash commands which need to be registered with discord.

<ol>
    <li>While still in the project directory, run <code>npm install</code> to install the required packages</li>
    <li>Then run <code>node setupCommands.js</code> to register slash commands for the bot with discord</li>
</ol>

## Running the Bot

This bot was written to run locally or on docker with NodeJS and PostgreSQL and uses Env-Files for the senstive data that will get loaded in NodeJS as Environment Variables.

### Run in Docker

**Important:** _You must have already set up a Discord bot on the Discord Developer portal. If you haven't, follow the instructions in [this](#discord-bot-setup) section first._

<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/">Set up Docker</a> if you haven't already.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the bot with Docker Compose: <br><code>docker compose up -d</code><br>
    </li>
</ol>

### Run Locally

You can also run the bot using node, but the database has to be set up manually.

<ol>
    <li>
        Set up your database if you haven't already. The bot was built using Postgres but other DBs can work if they allow a connection string with user/pass. If you don't use the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> environment variable, you'd have to adjust the dialect for Sequelize in data/postgres.js.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the command:
        <br><code>node index.js</code>
        <br>or
        <br><code>npm start</code> 
    </li>
</ol>

# Technology

## PostgreSQL

The database.

## node.js

This project is written entirely using JavaScript in the [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment.

## discord.js

All interactions with discord were handled thanks to the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

## Poké-API

This bot would not be possible without [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). This API provided a list of all pokémon, including their variants, as well as sprites that were instrumental in building this Poke-guesser Bot.
